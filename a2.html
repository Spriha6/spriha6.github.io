const int buttonPin = 2;  
const int redPin = 11;
const int greenPin = 10;

        <h2> Questions & Answers </h2>

        <p><strong>1.  Draw a chart where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage. Draw 3 lines representing the voltage across an LED with analogWrite(led, 64), analogWrite(led, 128), and analogWrite(led, 255). </strong><br>
          Alongwrite method would mean there is no fading. Each graph is independent, showing how that particular PWM value behaves over time.</p>

         <img src="A2-Q1.jpg" alt="Voltage vs Time Graph for an LED">
       <p><strong>2. Given your schematic, circuit, and firmware, assuming the only thing that draws current is your LEDs, how long would your circuit run if powered by a 1200 mAh battery?</strong><br>
          LED current at 255 PWM, So I (current) = 20 mA x 0.5 = 10mA. (The average brightness in a fade cycle is 50%) So battery life is 1200 mAh / 10mA = 120 hours (5 days). </p>
     
       <p><strong>3. Measure and record the actual voltage across one of your LEDs when it's on. How does this compare to the theoretical forward voltage for your LED color?</strong><br>
         When the LED shows the color red and it is fully on, the reading is about 2.0 V across the LED. 
         Calculations: 
         Voltage Supply: 5.0 V
         Measured V_LED: 2.0 V
         Resistor: 220 ohm
         
         I = (5.0 - 2.0) / 220 = 3.0 / 220 = 13.6 mA 
         The value 13.6 mA current value matches the theoretical forward voltage range: 1.8 - 2.2 V
         The measured voltage falls within the expected range, confirming that the LED is operating as specified. </p>
     
       <p><strong>4. Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment?</strong><br>
          I used ChatGPT for setting up my websight and IDE. I was having trouble with setting ym portfolio website and downloading the zip from the github. I had to restart multiple times. I gave it prompts like my 'template' and 'spriha.github.io' are not synced and then what should i do. < /p>
