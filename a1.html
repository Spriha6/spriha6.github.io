        <p>Arduino code used to control the LEDs:</p>
        <pre><code>
// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
// Define LED pins connected to digital pins 9, 5, 3
int led1 = 9;  // LED 1 connected to pin 9
int led2 = 5;  // LED 2 connected to pin 5
int led3 = 3;  // LED 3 connected to pin 3

void setup() {
  // Set each LED pin as an OUTPUT
  pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(led3, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {

        <h2>Questions & Answers</h2>
      
        <p><strong>1.  Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs</strong><br>
           I created square-wave graphs for each LED showing voltage vs. time. Each LED line rises to ~2V when on and drops to 0V when off, staggered according to the delays in the Arduino code.</p>

          <img src="A0-Graph.jpg" alt="Voltage vs Time Graph for LEDs">
        <p><strong>2. How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</strong><br>
           About 10 LEDs can blink independently on an Arduino without exceeding the recommended total current (20mA per LED, total â‰¤200mA). For 3 LEDs, the current draw is 43.5mA because each LED draws a 1.8v from the 5v, and each resistor has a 220ohm resistance.</p>
      
        <p><strong>3. How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</strong><br>
          Human eyes perceive flicker as continuous light above ~ 50 Hz. This means each on/off cycle should be less than = 20 ms. 
          In Arduino code, this corresponds to a delay of about 10 ms per HIGH and 10 ms per LOW.</p>
      
        <p><strong>4. Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment?</strong><br>
           I used ChatGPT for setting up my websight and IDE. I was having trouble with setting ym portfolio website and downloading the zip from the github. I had to restart multiple times. I gave it prompts like my 'template' and 'spriha.github.io' are not synced and then what should i do. < /p>
